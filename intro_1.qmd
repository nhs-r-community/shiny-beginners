## What is Shiny?

::: incremental
-   Shiny is a web application programming framework
-   The language of the web (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) all called from R
-   It requires no knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, but if you have that knowledge you can add more of these languages
:::

## Let's create a shiny app - on a computer

::: incremental
-   Go to `File > New Project... > New Directory`
-   Select `Shiny Application`
-   Browse to the location you want the new folder to go to
-   Name your new project!
:::

. . .

## Projects

-   Using projects is a good habit to get into
-   Creating a specific project through the RStudio provides all the relevant documents needed
:::

## Let's create a shiny app - in Posit Cloud

::: incremental
-   Go to `File > New File > Shiny Web App...`
-   Or use the short menu below `File`
-   Name your new project!
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Posit Cloud workspaces are all projects!

-   Because the Cloud is a project it doesn't need creating
-   What we do here you can also do on your own computer

## Running the app

Changing the inputs (from the slider) changes the outputs (the chart)

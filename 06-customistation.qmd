## Layouts

The layouts of Shiny apps are very flexible with customisation using Shiny functions or even HTML code.

::: {.incremental}
- Comprehensive documentation can be found for Shiny in R on the [Posit website](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/build/layout-guide/) ([Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/) too!).

- [Galleries](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/) can give you and idea of what is possible, along with the code.

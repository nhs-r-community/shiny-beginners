## Brief overview of options

::: {.incremental}
- Details of the options, and implications for sensitive data can be found on NHS-R's [Statement on Tools](https://tools.nhsrcommunity.com/statement-on-using-tools-shiny.html)

- Wherever data is sensitive the ideal is to host a Shiny app using something like [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/).

- More information on non-sensitive data options can be followed from the [Shiny Intro book](https://debruine.github.io/shinyintro/sharing.html#shinyapps.io) from PsyTeachR.

- Setting that up is beyond the scope of this course but there will be people in NHS-R Community who have experience of doing this in their organisations.

## Share in an R package

For other R users one of the best ways to launch the Shiny, without having to open a particular script and run a button, it is possible to launch it from an [R package](https://debruine.github.io/shinyintro/sharing.html#in-an-r-package).

Creating an R package is easy to set up with a package called {usethis} and there is a great slide deck on how to get set up started through R Forwards:

* [Setting up your system](http://bit.ly/pkg-dev-2)

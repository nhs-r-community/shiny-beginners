## What is Shiny?

-   Shiny is a web application programming framework
-   The language of the web (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) all called from R
-   It requires no knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, but if you have that knowledge you can add more of these languages


## Examples of Shiny

The [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/) which includes dashboards as well as parts (widgets) that can be added.

And from healthcare:

## Mental Health Surge Model app

## Patient Feedback text mining app

## Create an example shiny app

::: incremental
-   Go to `File > New Project... > New Directory`
-   Select `Shiny Application`
-   Browse to the location you want the new folder to go to
-   Name your new project
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Projects

-   Using projects is a good habit to get into
-   Creating a specific project through the RStudio provides all the relevant documents needed
:::

## Let's create a shiny template app - in Posit Cloud

::: incremental
-   Go to `File > New File > Shiny Web App...`
-   Or use the short menu below `File`
-   Name your new project!
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Posit Cloud workspaces are all projects!

-   Because the Cloud is a project it doesn't need creating
-   What we do here you can also do on your own computer
:::

## Running the app

![](img/screenshot-run-app.PNG){fig-alt="Screenshot of the RStudio pane under Tools and Help with the Run app icon and words" fig-align="center" width="582"}

Changing the inputs (from the slider) changes the outputs (the chart)

## Viewing as a pop-up... or not

::: {.info data-latex=""}
![](img/rstudio_run_app.png)
You can change whether the app opens in a separate window in RStudio, the RStudio viewer pane, or externally in your web browser. Use whichever works best for you and your computer setup.
:::

## Listening?

Before closing the app look at the R Console:

```{r}
#> Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3827
```

127.0.0.1 “this computer” and 3827 is a randomly assigned port number.

. . .

:::{.callout-important collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## R is busy!
- The R prompt isn't visible
- The console toolbar has a stop sign icon
- No other commands can be used until the Shiny app is stopped!
- To stop click the stop sign, `Esc` or `Ctrl + C` in some programs
:::

## Developing a Shiny app

The workflow is:

- Write code
- Start app
- Play with app
- Repeat

In RStudio you don't need to stop and start just `Reload app`

## Your turn 

- Use `File > New File > Shiny Web App...`
- Drag the slider and see the histogram change
- Change the colour of the histogram fill to "blue"
- Change the title of the application

## End session

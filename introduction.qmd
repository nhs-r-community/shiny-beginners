## What is Shiny?

::: incremental
-   Shiny is a web application programming framework
-   The language of the web (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) all called from R
-   It requires no knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, but if you have that knowledge you can add more of these languages
:::

## Let's create a shiny app - on a computer

::: incremental
-   Go to `File > New Project... > New Directory`
-   Select `Shiny Application`
-   Browse to the location you want the new folder to go to
-   Name your new project!
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Projects

-   Using projects is a good habit to get into
-   Creating a specific project through the RStudio provides all the relevant documents needed
:::

## Let's create a shiny template app - in Posit Cloud

::: incremental
-   Go to `File > New File > Shiny Web App...`
-   Or use the short menu below `File`
-   Name your new project!
:::

. . .

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Posit Cloud workspaces are all projects!

-   Because the Cloud is a project it doesn't need creating
-   What we do here you can also do on your own computer
:::

## Running the app

![](img/screenshot-run-app.PNG){fig-alt="Screenshot of the RStudio pane under Tools and Help with the Run app icon and words" fig-align="center" width="582"}

Changing the inputs (from the slider) changes the outputs (the chart)

## Listening?

Before closing the app look at the R Console:

```{r}
#> Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3827
```

127.0.0.1 “this computer” and 3827 is a randomly assigned port number.

. . .

:::{.callout-important collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## R is busy!
- The R prompt isn't visible
- The console toolbar has a stop sign icon
- No other commands can be used until the Shiny app is stopped!
- To stop click the stop sign, `Esc` or `Ctrl + C` in some programs
:::

## Developing a Shiny app

The workflow is:

::: {.incremental}
- Write code
- Start app
- Play with app
- Write more code
- Repeat
- And in RStudio you don't need to stop and start just `Reload app`

## Examples of Shiny

The [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/) which includes dashboards as well as parts (widgets) that can be added.

And from healthcare:

## Mental Health Surge Model app

[![](img/mental_health_modelling.PNG){fig-alt="Screenshot of Mental Health Modelling app from The Strategy Unit used to estimate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health services in England"}](https://strategyunit.shinyapps.io/MH_Surge_Modelling/)

## Patient Feedback text mining app

## The future of Shiny - is here!

As RStudio renamed to Posit in 2022 to extend their language association beyond R, so they are also working on extending Shiny apps

::: {.incremental}
- To be compatible with the power of [Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/)
- To publish without a server using [Shinylive](https://jcheng5.github.io/posit-conf-2023-shinylive/#/title-slide)
- An example is this [app](https://matt-dray.github.io/govspeakify-tables/) that converts a table to Govspeak Markdown, the format required for publishing reports by the UK's government from Matt Dray's [blog](https://www.rostrum.blog/posts/2023-10-08-govspeakify-tables/)
